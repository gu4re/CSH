# CSH 
#### *A simplified version of bash using C!*

The purpose of this project is to provide a basic understanding of how a shell works, how processes and subprocesses comunicate with the OS System and how commands are executed by a shell. Some commands are still emulating the behaviour of UNIX commands such as *"cd"* and *"umask"*. Probably they will be changed in a future release.
